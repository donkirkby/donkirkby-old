#summary Twitter updates in Chinese for reading practice
#labels Chinese

I've been looking for some Chinese text that I could sort through looking for sentences that only use characters I know. That way I could practice my reading without getting too frustrated by having to look up a ton of vocabulary. I realized that Twitter contains small chunks of text, so I got Google to find all the tweets in Chinese. Then I wrote a program to fetch the search results from Google, get the tweets from Twitter, and then find the ones that only use the 500 most frequently used characters. Here are some of my favourites so far:

Unfortunately, it appears that Leslie may have died, so I feel a bit awkward using this as reading practice. ||
