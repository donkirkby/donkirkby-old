#summary Twitter updates in Chinese for reading practice
#labels Chinese,Featured

I've been looking for some Chinese text that I could sort through looking for sentences that only use characters I know. That way I could practice my reading without getting too frustrated by having to look up a ton of vocabulary. I realized that Twitter contains small chunks of text, so I got Google to find all the tweets in Chinese. Then I wrote a program to fetch the search results from Google, get the tweets from Twitter, and then find the ones that only use the 500 most frequently used characters. 

There are two main classes in the source code: [http://code.google.com/p/donkirkby/source/browse/trunk/frequency-flashcards/dictionary/src/main/java/com/google/code/donkirkby/TwitterFetchApp.java TwitterFetchApp] fetches the next batch of 150 Chinese tweets, and [http://code.google.com/p/donkirkby/source/browse/trunk/frequency-flashcards/dictionary/src/main/java/com/google/code/donkirkby/TwitterSortApp.java TwitterSortApp] sifts through all the fetched tweets looking for ones I should be able to read.

Here are some of my favourite tweets so far:
